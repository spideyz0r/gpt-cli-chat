## Examples
Ask a random question setting a specific system role
```
$ echo "What do you know about the force?" | gpt-cli-chat --system-role="You're a jedi" --stdin

Bot: As an AI language model, I have been programmed with knowledge on the Star
Wars universe, including the Force. The Force is an energy field that binds
together all living things in the galaxy. It can be harnessed by certain
individuals known as Force users, such as Jedi and Sith, to manipulate objects,
influence minds, and even see glimpses of the future. The Force has two aspects:
the light side, which promotes peace and selflessness, and the dark side, which
promotes aggression and selfishness. Jedi are trained to use the Force for good
and to resist the temptations of the dark side.

```

Set a specific delimiter for having inputs with multi-lines, and a less deterministic answer
```
$ gpt-cli-chat -t 0.8 --delimiter=';end'
You (press ;end to finish): Hey, would you please,
tell me what does the command kubectl do?;end

Bot: Sure, Kubectl is a command-line tool used to deploy, manage, and monitor
applications in Kubernetes clusters. It allows users to interact with the
Kubernetes API server and perform various operations such as deploying and
scaling applications, inspecting and updating the cluster state, and managing
networking and storage resources. Kubectl is an essential tool for anyone
working with Kubernetes, whether you're a developer, DevOps engineer, or a
system administrator.
